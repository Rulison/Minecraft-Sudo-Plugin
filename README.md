Minecraft-Sudo-Plugin
=====================

Small minecraft mod that allows users on a server to use only specific commands without granting them full permissions.

For use mainly with command blocks.  Precede a command with "comWrap", meaning command wrap, and the command will be executed by a dummy player that cannot do anything, but has full permissions.

I used this in my server when I wanted users to be able to use certain commands as part of the WorldEdit mod but without giving them full WorldEdit permissions.
